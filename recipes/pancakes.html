<p>This recipe uses basic ingredients you likely already have in your kitchen. The key to fluffy pancakes is not to overmix the batter!</p>
<h4>Yields</h4>
<li>About 8-10 pancakes</li>
<h4>Prep Time</h4>
<li>10 Minutes</li>
<h4>Cook time:</h4>
<li>10-15m minutes</li>
<h2>Ingredients</h2>
<ul>
  <li>1 ½ cups (190 g) all-purpose flour</li>
  <li>2 tablespoons granulated sugar</li>
  <li>2 teaspoons baking powder</li>
  <li>½ teaspoon salt</li>
  <li>1 ¼ cups (295 ml) milk (any kind works: whole, 2%, or even almond milk)</li>
  <li>1 large egg</li>
  <li>3 tablespoons unsalted butter, melted and slightly cooled
  </li>
  <li>1 teaspoon vanilla extract (optional, but recommended for flavor)</li>
  <li>Extra butter or oil for the pan
  </li>
</ul>
<h2>Instructions</h2>
<ol>
  <li>Combine Dry Ingredients: In a large bowl, whisk together the flour, sugar, baking powder, and salt. This helps to distribute the leavening agents evenly.</li>
  <li>Combine Wet Ingredients: In a separate medium bowl, whisk together the milk and the egg. Then, slowly whisk in the melted butter and vanilla extract (if using).</li>
  <li>Mix Batter: Pour the wet ingredients into the bowl with the dry ingredients. Gently mix with a whisk or spatula until everything is just combined. Do not overmix! A few lumps in the batter are perfectly fine and are the secret to tender pancakes.</li>
  <li>Rest the Batter (Optional but Recommended): Let the batter rest for 5-10 minutes while you heat your pan. This allows the gluten to relax and the baking powder to start working, resulting in a fluffier pancake.</li>
  <li>Heat the Pan: Place a non-stick skillet or griddle over medium heat. Add a small amount of butter or oil to coat the surface. You'll know the pan is ready when a drop of water sizzles and evaporates quickly.</li>
  <li>Cook the Pancakes: Pour about ¼ cup of batter onto the hot pan for each pancake. Cook for 2-3 minutes on the first side. You'll know it's time to flip when bubbles start to form and pop on the surface and the edges look dry.</li>
  <li>Flip and Finish: Flip the pancakes carefully with a thin spatula and cook for another 1-2 minutes on the other side, until golden brown.</li>
  <li>Serve and Enjoy: Serve the pancakes immediately while hot, with your favorite toppings like butter, maple syrup, fresh fruit, or whipped cream.</li>
</ol>
<p>Pro-Tip: To keep the first batch of pancakes warm while you cook the rest, place them on a baking sheet in an oven preheated to 200°F (95°C).</p>
