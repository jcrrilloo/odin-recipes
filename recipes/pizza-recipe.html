<h2>Part 3: Assembling and Baaking Your Pizza</h2>
<p>Now for the fun part - putting it all together!</p>
<h3>Ingredients</h3>
<ul>
  <li>1 ball of prepared pizza dough</li>
  <li>½ cup of prepared pizza sauce</li>
  <li>2 cups (about 8 ounces) shredded low-moisture mozzarella cheese</li>
  <li>4-5 ounces sliced pepperoni</li>
  <li>Optional: A sprinkle of Parmesan cheese, red pepper flakes, or fresh basil for garnish.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Instructions:</h3>
<ol>
  <li>Preheat Oven: Place a pizza stone or an inverted baking sheet in your oven and preheat to the highest temperature possible, typically 475-500°F (245-260°C). Let the stone/sheet heat up for at least 30 minutes</li>
  <li>Shape the Dough: Punch down the risen dough to release the air. On a lightly floured surface, gently stretch the dough into a 14 to 16-inch circle. You can use your hands or a rolling pin.</li>
  <li>Top the Pizza: Place the shaped dough on a piece of parchment paper or a pizza peel lightly dusted with cornmeal. Spread a thin layer of sauce over the dough, leaving a small border for the crust.</li>
  <li>Add Cheese and Pepperoni: Sprinkle the mozzarella cheese evenly over the sauce. Arrange the pepperoni slices on top.</li>
  <li>Bake: Carefully slide the pizza (with the parchment paper, if using) onto the preheated pizza stone or baking sheet. Bake for 12-15 minutes, or until the crust is golden brown and the cheese is bubbly and slightly browned.</li>
  <li>Rest and Serve: Remove the pizza from the oven and let it cool for a few minutes before slicing and serving. This allows the cheese to set. Garnish with fresh basil or a sprinkle of Parmesan if desired.</li>
</ol>
<p>Enjoy your delicious homemaade pepperoni pizza!</p>
